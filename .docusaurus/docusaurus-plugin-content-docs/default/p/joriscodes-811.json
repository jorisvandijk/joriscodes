It mainly focusses on Linux, software, coding and other computer related topics.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/automounting":{"id":"linux/automounting","title":"Auto mounting a drive","description":"fstab","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/compose-key":{"id":"linux/compose-key","title":"Compose key","description":"For the longest time I have disabled my CapsLock key. I used to hit it from time to time and get annoyed by having to redo the bit I was typing, but this time not in all caps. For a little while I also used it in a keybinding, but found that using VoidSymbol (the key it will register as when disabled) is flakey. So this left me with a big button, right on the home row of my keyboard that does nothing at all, which is a waste.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/distraction-free-youtube":{"id":"linux/distraction-free-youtube","title":"Distraction free YouTube videos","description":"I'm trying to only enjoy content I like. I try not to get involved in social media. Not to get into that trap of watching one thing followed by the next, and then the next thing. I don't do Twiter, I don't do Facebook, I don't do Instagram, I don't do Tiktok. I do like some content on YouTube. This presents me with a problem. If I were to go to the site they offer, I'd watch the video I came for and then I'd watch the next one they offer, and then the following and then... well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole I want to not get into. Hence I found a solution to this, by making sure I only watch what I like and nothing more.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/global-playback-control":{"id":"linux/global-playback-control","title":"Global playback control","description":"I love to use MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification), which is a standard DBUS interface to manage (among other things) audio playback on your system. I use it through playerctl, which is a command line utility which provides a command line interface to media players that support MPRIS.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/Scripting/ArchMaintenance":{"id":"linux/Scripting/ArchMaintenance","title":"Arch Linux Maintenance","description":"It's a good idea to keep your system well maintained. Arch has a wiki article in which they describe best practices on how to maintain your Arch system according to them.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/Scripting/ScreenShot":{"id":"linux/Scripting/ScreenShot","title":"ScreenShot","description":"So I have been using scrot to take screenshots for ages. The only downside has been the inability to grab just a portion of the screen. There are newer applications that do this out of the box. Applications like Flameshot. The downside of that application is that it pulls the entire Qt5-base and several other Qt applications down with it. I do not use any Qt applications, so having to pull down all of those just to take a partial screenshot is insane to me.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"linux/thunar-text-file":{"id":"linux/thunar-text-file","title":"Open text file in a terminal editor from Thunar","description":"For some reason I like to use Thunar as a file manager. It's been my go-to for years now. It has worked a treat for ages, however I used to want to edit text files (like configuration files) in Code (the editor). I don't anymore. I want to be able to edit those files in Micro, which runs in the terminal.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"programming/cpp-version":{"id":"programming/cpp-version","title":"Check C++ version","description":"Create a file called version.cpp and add the following code:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"software/Firefox/extensions":{"id":"software/Firefox/extensions","title":"Extensions","description":"Extensions make your browsing experience better, or at least some extensions will.

But you might end up contributing to that repository and you may need to access it over SSH now. You could just delete the entire local folder and grab it again using SSH, but you could also switch your HTTPS repo to an SSH one...","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}}

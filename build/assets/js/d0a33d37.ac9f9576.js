I used to hit it from time to time and get annoyed by having to redo the bit I was typing, but this time not in all caps. For a little while I also used it in a keybinding, but found that using VoidSymbol (the key it will register as when disabled) is flakey. So this left me with a big button, right on the home row of my keyboard that does nothing at all, which is a waste.","permalink":"/linux/compose-key"},{"id":"linux/passkey-ssh","title":"Connect to SSH using keys instead of password","description":"An RSA keypair will be created using the following commands. This will allow for connecting to a server from your machine without using a password.","permalink":"/linux/passkey-ssh"},{"id":"linux/distraction-free-youtube","title":"Distraction free YouTube videos","description":"I\'m trying to only enjoy content I like. I try not to get involved in social media. Not to get into that trap of watching one thing followed by the next, and then the next thing. I don\'t do Twitter, I don\'t do Facebook, I don\'t do Instagram, I don\'t do Tiktok. I do like some content on YouTube. This presents me with a problem. If I were to go to the site they offer, I\'d watch the video I came for and then I\'d watch the next one they offer, and then the following and then... well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole I want to not get into. Hence I found a solution to this, by making sure I only watch what I like and nothing more.","permalink":"/linux/distraction-free-youtube"},{"id":"software/Firefox/extensions","title":"Extensions","description":"Extensions make your browsing experience better, or at least some extensions will. I will explain why I use each of the following and I\'ll try to convince you that you should at least try (some of) them for yourself. I\'m going to list these worst-to-best, though they are all amazing in their own right.","permalink":"/software/Firefox/extensions"},{"id":"linux/global-playback-control","title":"Global playback control","description":"I love to use MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification), which is a standard DBUS interface to manage (among other things) audio playback on your system. I use it through playerctl, which is a command line utility which provides a command line interface to media players that support MPRIS.","permalink":"/linux/global-playback-control"},{"id":"linux/fzf-and-arch-software-install","title":"Installing software on Arch Linux with fzf","description":"Fuzzy file finding is amazing. It really is. You can search a query containing at least part of what you\'re looking for and it\'ll find it. It\'s like magic. My fuzzy file finder of choice is called fzf.","permalink":"/linux/fzf-and-arch-software-install"},{"id":"linux/managing-dotfiles","title":"Managing dotfiles","description":"Everyone handles backing up their dotfiles in their own way.

It\'s been my go-to for years now. It has worked a treat for ages, however I used to want to edit text files (like configuration files) in Code (the editor). I don\'t anymore. I want to be able to edit those files in Micro, which runs in the terminal.","permalink":"/linux/thunar-text-file"},{"id":"linux/Scripting/ScreenShot","title":"ScreenShot","description":"So I have been using scrot to take screenshots for ages. The only downside has been the inability to grab just a portion of the screen. There are newer applications that do this out of the box. Applications like Flameshot. The downside of that application is that it pulls the entire Qt5-base and several other Qt applications down with it. I do not use any Qt applications, so having to pull down all of those just to take a partial screenshot is insane to me.","permalink":"/linux/Scripting/ScreenShot"},{"id":"linux/sorting-movie-directory","title":"Sorting your movie directory","description":"Movie\\\\","permalink":"/linux/sorting-movie-directory"},{"id":"software/Firefox/userChrome","title":"userChrome.css","description":"I use Firefox as my main web browser.

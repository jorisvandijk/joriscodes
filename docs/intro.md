# Welcome
This website is a collection of notes, tips and tricks that I've collected over the years. It mainly focusses on Linux, software, coding, programming and other computer related topics. It is a second brain, if you will. Feel free to use it for your own purposes. If you have any suggestions, questions or other feedback, please let me know.

## Dotfiles
I have several computers and for now they use different dotfiles. Currently my Thinkpad dotfiles are most up to date. In the future I will streamline this somehow.

## Who am I?
I'm Joris and I am from the Netherlands. I'm a student currently working to get my computer science bachelor degree. Apart from that I am an open-source advocate, a Linux enthusiast and a favorite uncle.

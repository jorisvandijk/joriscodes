# userChrome.css
I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) as my main web browser. I have been for decades. The only thing I really dislike about it is the total amount of space the UI takes up.

I don't care much for tabs, so I don't need an entire row for them. Usually I have one or two tabs open at a time, up to a maximum of six in rare occasions. Another bit of lost screen real-estate is the enormous URL/search bar. Mozilla even recognizes this and adds empty space next to both sides of the bar by default to not make it as big.

There is also a refresh button I'll never touch (due to *F5* existing); a Pocket icon, which I don't use and it also features a hamburger menu I never want to navigate (as I can get to settings by either pressing *Alt* to bring up the entire menu bar or by pressing *Ctrl+Shift+A*, and then clicking **Firefox Settings** at the bottom left). 

## Using userChrome.css
I like a clean experience, so for years I used a custom `userChrome.css` file. This file makes it possible to edit, move or remove certain elements of the Firefox UI. For a long while I used a `userChrome.css` file I made myself, which was an assortment of bits of CSS code I found online, which I edited to suit my needs. This worked fine, but not perfectly, so I went and started to search for a better solution.

After some searching I found [LR Tech's OnelineProton](https://github.com/lr-tech/OnelineProton/), which offers an easy to customize, one-line Firefox `useChrome.css` file. I copied it and edited it so that it's exactly how I want it.

## Installing 
The process of installing a `userChrome.css` file is quite easy, just follow the steps below (which LR kindly provided) and you'll too have an awesome Firefox experience!

1. In the search bar, type **about:config**. A dialog will be shown to you. Press the *I accept the risk* button.
2. Search for **toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets** and change it to *True*.
3. Go to your Firefox profile:
    In the search bar, type **about:support** and press Enter.
    Search for Profile Directory and click on *Open Directory button*.
4. Create a folder and name it **chrome** (all lowercase).
5. Paste `userChrome.css` file into the folder.
6. Restart Firefox
7. Enjoy your new Firefox!

I try not to get involved in social media. Not to get into that trap of watching one thing followed by the next, and then the next thing. I don\'t do Twitter, I don\'t do Facebook, I don\'t do Instagram, I don\'t do Tiktok. I do like some content on YouTube. This presents me with a problem. If I were to go to the site they offer, I\'d watch the video I came for and then I\'d watch the next one they offer, and then the following and then... well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole I want to not get into. Hence I found a solution to this, by making sure I only watch what I like and nothing more.","permalink":"/linux/distraction-free-youtube"},{"id":"linux/global-playback-control","title":"Global playback control","description":"I love to use MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification), which is a standard DBUS interface to manage (among other things) audio playback on your system.

# Welcome
This website is a collection of my notes, tips and tricks that I've collected over the years. It mainly focusses on Linux, software, coding and other computer related topics. 

## Dotfiles
I have several computers and for now they use different dotfiles. Currently my Thinkpad dotfiles are most up to date. In the future I will streamline this somehow.

## Who am I?
I'm Joris, a software developer to be, from the Netherlands. I like Linux, Software and Technology.

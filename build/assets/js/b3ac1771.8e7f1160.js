I try not to get involved in social media. Not to get into that trap of watching one thing followed by the next, and then the next thing.

If I were to go to the site they offer, I\'d watch the video I came for and then I\'d watch the next one they offer, and then the following and then... well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole I want to not get into. Hence I found a solution to this, by making sure I only watch what I like and nothing more.","permalink":"/linux/distraction-free-youtube"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);

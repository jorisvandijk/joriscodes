I realized that the knowledge stored there was hard to find, for me and hence probably also for others. I found myself going back to the site and endlessly searching for things and I thought: why not make this easier?\\n\\nEnter Docusaurus. I had heard of it before, but never really looked into it. It\'s a static site generator, but with a twist: it\'s built for creating documentation websites, but it\'s also perfectly at home creating blog posts. The huge red flag it has, is that it is build by Meta, the company behind Facebook. So before I took the plunge, I looked at and tried many alternatives, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and several others. None of them worked for me. Either they were too simple, or needed too much hacking to make them work as I wanted them to.\\n\\nReluctantly I started looking into Docusaurus, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has a very clean and modern look to it, and the documentation is great. It has a very developer-friendly approach to building websites and most importantly, it is not Meta, it is [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/). This means that while it is backed by Meta, it is still open source software, making it acceptable for me to use.\\n\\nIn the future I will be adding more content to the site. Mostly I will be adding to the documentation, as that is the main purpose of this site. But I also plan on adding more blog posts, maybe even some random thoughts and I might also port old blog posts from the other website over as well. We\'ll see. \\n\\nFor now enjoy this website and I hope you find it useful. If you have any suggestions, questions or other feedback, please let me know."}]}}')}}]);

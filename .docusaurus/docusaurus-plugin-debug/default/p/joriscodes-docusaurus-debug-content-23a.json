I used to hit it from time to time and get annoyed by having to redo the bit I was typing, but this time not in all caps.

I try not to get involved in social media. Not to get into that trap of watching one thing followed by the next, and then the next thing. I don't do Twiter, I don't do Facebook, I don't do Instagram, I don't do Tiktok. I do like some content on YouTube. This presents me with a problem. If I were to go to the site they offer, I'd watch the video I came for and then I'd watch the next one they offer, and then the following and then... well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole I want to not get into.
